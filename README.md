# BRICS--HANDLOOM-SIMULATION

China hosts the BRICS summit, an international gathering that aims to promote cooperation, security, prosperity, and peace in the technologies. BRICS is an acronym for the powerful grouping of the world's leading emerging market economies, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Web games and simulations are still popular. We had the opportunity to demonstrate our proficiency in WebGL simulation development using Unity Engine at BRICS under the emerging field AR/VR. We created a Hand Loom simulation and had success building and deploying a WEB simulation on it. The functioning simulation has been deployed using the itch.io server and the link is attached below.
